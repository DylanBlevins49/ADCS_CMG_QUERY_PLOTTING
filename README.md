# This program will read data in from a .csv and plot/save the figures for later use.

## To use this program:

**Ensure that the file you want to use is in the same directory as the code** <br>
**Ensure that you use the proper file name;** *line 7 (df = pd.read_csv('Insert_File_Name.csv'))* <br>
**Ensure that you use the best naming conventions to suit your needs for saving the figure** *(Proper_File_Name.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')* **Can also be saved in .svg format** <br>
**Adjust any figure parameters as needed to best suit your needs** *(You will need to change it in each plot code block if you want to change all together, or in the X axis format helper functions)* <br>
