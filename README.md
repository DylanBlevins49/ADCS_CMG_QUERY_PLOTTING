This program will read data in from a .csv and plot/save the figures for later use.

To use this program:

Ensure that you use the proper file name; line 7 (df = pd.read_csv('Insert_File_Name.csv'))
Ensure that you use the best naming conventions to suit your needs for saving the figure (Proper_File_Name.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight').. Can also be saved in .svg format
Adjust any figure parameters as needed to best suit your needs (You will need to change it in each plot code block if you want to change all together)
